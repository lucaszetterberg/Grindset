# ZigmaRunner
:joystick: The game is a runner type game consisting of the character running from some enemy for as long as it survives. The game should have obstacle generation and potentially some kind of progression system, not unlike other endless runner games that most people are familiar with. The project is a part of the course DD1349. The project is going to take place under 4 weeks and by the end of the period the game is due to be finished. The complexity of the game and number of features may vary depending on time since both developers have little experience in game development. The currently proposed plan may change depending on the workflow.
