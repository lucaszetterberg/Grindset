# ZigmaRunner
:joystick: The game is a runner type game consisting of the character running from some enemy for as long as it survives. The game should have obstacle generation and potentially some kind of progression system, not unlike other endless runner games that most people are familiar with. The project is a part of the course DD1349. The project is going to take place under 4 weeks and by the end of the period the game is due to be finished. The complexity of the game and number of features may vary depending on time since both developers have little experience in game development. The currently proposed plan may change depending on the workflow.

## Install and Play

To play the game the user must have access to this github repo in order to clone it and have access to the files. In order to clone the repo the user must ensure that they have an active `ssh-key` connected to their github account, otherwise the user must get one. To be able to open the files the user must have the programming language python installed on the computer along with the libraries namned under `Technologies`. To then start the game the user has to navigate in their terminal to the cloned folder and run the main file with the command `python ZRMain.py`. 

The game controls are very simple with using either `SPACE` or the `UP` key. To slide the player has to press the `DOWN` key. The game speed will increase the longer the player keeps running.
